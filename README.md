**Maze Game**
This C# maze game allows users to solve randomly generated mazes using arrow keys for navigation. Additionally, it features an optimal path displayed after solving the maze using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. The game also tracks the time taken by the user to complete the maze and provides a notification upon successful completion.

**Installation**
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the solution in Visual Studio or your preferred C# IDE.

Upon starting the game, a randomly generated maze will be displayed.
Use the arrow keys to navigate through the maze.
Navigate to the exit marked 'E' while avoiding walls represented by '#' characters.
Once the exit is reached, a notification will appear indicating completion and the time taken to solve the maze.

**Features**
Randomly generated mazes: Each time a new game starts, a unique maze is generated for the user to solve.
Arrow key navigation: Users can navigate through the maze using the arrow keys on their keyboard.
Optimal path visualization: After solving the maze using the BFS algorithm, the optimal path will be displayed in the maze.
Time tracking: The game tracks the time taken by the user to solve the maze and displays it upon completion.
Completion notification: Upon reaching the exit of the maze, users receive a notification indicating successful completion along with their time taken.

**Dependencies**
